		HTML/CSS: Proficiency in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is fundamental. These are the building blocks of web development, with HTML defining the structure of web content and CSS controlling its presentation and layout.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a crucial scripting language for front-end development. It's used to add interactivity, handle user input, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update web content. Familiarity with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) is often beneficial.

Responsive Web Design: Front-end developers should have a strong understanding of responsive web design principles. This includes creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, using techniques like media queries and flexible grid systems.

Version Control/Git: Proficiency in version control systems like Git is essential for collaborative development. It allows developers to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their codebase.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: Front-end developers need to ensure that websites and applications work consistently across various web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Understanding browser compatibility issues and using techniques like polyfills can help achieve this.
